# The Inner Circle: groomsmen invite

A password-gated, single-page invite for three groomsmen. Static HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Personalize (launch checklist)

1. **Photos.** Drop these into `assets/` (JPG, any size; they're cropped automatically):
   - `group-photo.jpg` (landscape works best)
   - `guy-1.jpg` (your brother), `guy-2.jpg` (Liam), `guy-3.jpg` (Brad), portrait works best
   - `couple.jpg` (you and Dasha), portrait works best

   Until you do, the SVG placeholders show instead.
2. **Passcode.** The default is `dayone`. Pick your inside joke, then generate its hash (lowercase it first; the site ignores case and surrounding spaces):
   ```bash
   echo -n 'yourpasscode' | shasum -a 256      # macOS
   echo -n 'yourpasscode' | sha256sum          # Linux
   ```
   Or open the site, open dev tools, and run `getHash('yourpasscode')`.
   Paste the hash into `TARGET_HASH` at the top of `app.js`, and update the hint text in `index.html`.
3. **Story copy.** In `index.html`, replace every `[bracketed]` placeholder and edit the blocks marked `EDIT:`: hint, opening, three tributes, the stag and wedding details, the envelope name, and the terms & conditions.
4. **Deploy.** See below, then test the link on your phone.

## Preview locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Use a local server rather than double-clicking the file: some browsers block the passcode check (Web Crypto) on `file://` pages.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
cd groomsmen-invite
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Groomsmen invite"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/groomsmen-invite.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then in the repo on GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `main` / `(root)` → Save.**
After a minute the site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/groomsmen-invite/`.

With the GitHub CLI you can do the repo creation and push in one step:
```bash
gh repo create groomsmen-invite --public --source=. --push
```

## Testing tips
- To see the gate again after unlocking, close the tab (sessionStorage clears) or run `sessionStorage.clear()` in the console.
- Test the confetti on a phone; it's the moment that matters.

## A note on privacy
The passcode gate keeps casual visitors out and keeps the passcode itself secret, but it is not real security: the page content is in the HTML source, which anyone with the URL can read. A free GitHub Pages site also requires a public repo. Don't put anything on the page you wouldn't want a stranger to stumble on, and keep the URL among the four of you. The page includes a `noindex` tag so search engines skip it.
